# startup a docker network to enables UI and database (ES) to communicate
docker network create simnet

# startup the database (ES) using a volume from the host filesystem to store its data directory
docker run -d --name elasticsearch --network simnet -v /home/michael/esdata:/usr/share/elasticsearch/data -p 9200:9200 -p 9300:9300 -e "discovery.type=single-node" elasticsearch:7.6.1

# startup the UI/API server
docker run -d --name simserver --network simnet -p 7777:7777 simserver:0.1

# The UI can be access from localhost:7777 and each session can be recorded using the UI's buttons.

Once started, the varying "times of interest" may be pulled from elasticsearch using the following record (modifying the json for which type of event we're interested in):
curl -X POST http://localhost:9200/recording_20200308_163014/_search?size=50 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"query" : {"bool" : {"must" : [{"match" : {"type" : "pickup_start"}}]}}}' | jq . | grep -e "\"time\":" | awk '{ print $5 }'

Event possibilities are:
- arrival
- order_start
- order_complete
- payment_start
- payment_complete
- pickup_start
- pickup_complete

Recorded details:
- 11 Balks
- Some times for the stations couldn't be accurately assessed due to queue delays (i.e., how long a person was "ordering" at the order station when they were unable to move forward once their order was completed.)
